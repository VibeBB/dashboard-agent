Review the contract and code against `dashboard-contract`,
`dashboard-platform-matrix`, `dashboard-protocol`, and `dashboard-webmcp`.
Prioritize unsafe device commands, incorrect framing, route/caveat mismatches,
undeclared capability assumptions, and generated artifact drift. Report
reproducible evidence and do not change the contract to hide a failed gate.
